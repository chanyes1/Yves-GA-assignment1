        <h1>Data Privacy</h1>
        <p>Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) in the Philippines was a very important event that aims at
            protecting the privacy of each individual filipino. It governs the collection, storage, and processing of
            personal data in both the private and public sectors. The law mandates that entities handling personal data
            implement appropriate security measures to prevent data breaches and ensure compliance. This legislation
            aligns with global standards such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
            reflecting the Philippines’ commitment to safeguarding citizens’ data in an increasingly digital world.
        </p>
        <p>However, the effectiveness of this law largely depends on the level of awareness and compliance by
            organizations and individuals. Many Filipinos still lack a basic understanding of their data privacy rights.
            They most often share personal information on social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and other digital
            services without considering how it may be used, sold, stored, or potentially exposed. This widespread lack
            of awareness opens opportunities for malicious actors to exploit sensitive data for criminal activities,
            such as identity theft, phishing, and online fraud..</p>
        <p>The National Privacy Commission (NPC), the regulatory body responsible for enforcing the Data Privacy Act,
            has been proactive in its efforts to raise public awareness and ensure compliance among organizations. Yet,
            there is still much work to be done, especially in educating the public about the risks and best practices
            for data protection. Campaigns emphasizing the importance of strong passwords, recognizing phishing
            attempts, and understanding privacy settings on social media platforms are essential steps towards
            empowering citizens. </p>
        <p>Although the cyber criminals have been caught, it is only the ones obvious enough to be traced, the
            technological capabilities of the Philippines is still steadily rising. For example, those who use
            pen-tester to get into government databases and steal information, or illegal black hat hacker groups who
            target critical health infrastracture back in 2021 when covid was rampant, there are many more other
            examples. And so, we need to enhance public
            awareness, fostering digital literacy, and ensuring stronger cybersecurity measures are necessary steps to
            create a safer and more secure digital environment for all.</p>

        <h1>Cybercrime Awareness</h1>
        <p>Cybercrimes such as hacking, online scams, identity theft, and cyberbullying have been growing in the
            Philippines steadily. And so, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175) was made to
            address these issues. This law defines various forms of cybercrime and outlines penalties for offenders. It
            also provides the framework for law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals.

        </p>
        <p>Scams involving fake online shops, phishing emails, and fraudulent investment schemes proliferate, preying on
            the unsuspecting. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated digital transformation, pushing more people
            online for work, education, and commerce, which also led to a surge in cybercrime incidents. This has led to
            many victims of scammers and hackers in the Philippines, targeting students, or any user of the cyberspace.
        </p>

    <div class="rectangle" id="hidden-rectangle">
        <h1>Question Asked</h1>
        <p>I asked a question in the lecture of what we will do if a group of cybercriminals somehow infiltrate and
            sabotage key infrastracture like government database, health facilities, logistic and communication systems,
            that may lead to ships being lost, planes without direction, hospital patients for hostage and many more.
        </p>
        <p>My answer to that is that it is a very complicated arms race to getting better security and infiltration
            techniques. From social engineering to backdoors or power supply control, there will always be new
            innovations made by the Black hat hackers and the white hat hackers.</p>
